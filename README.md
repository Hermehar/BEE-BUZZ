In this project, we aim to study whether there is any effect of the humidity has any effect on the presence of the queen bee in the beehive.
Furthermore, we are focusing on the climatic features of the beehive in order to find out the best combinations or ranges of hive temperature, hive pressure, hive humidity, when the queen bee is present and when it is not.
Finally, we intend to train the basic ML models including the Random Forest, KNN, and XGBOOST, to compare the results and will retain the model with best results.
